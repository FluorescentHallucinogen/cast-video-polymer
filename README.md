#cast-video
This element represents the video player in the [CastVideos-chrome-material](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-chrome-material) sample.

[Demo](http://googlecast.github.io/cast-video-polymer/demo.html)

## Overview
`cast-video` observes handles mediaLoad iron events from [`cast-manager`](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-manager-polymer), then loads the video, set duration, and fires an event to notify that loading is complete.
`cast-video` also observes other iron events from `cast-manager` to play, pause, seek and change volume.  This element serves as the source of truth for media currentTime and duration during local playback.

This element supports any HTML5 video format.

It encapsulates the [cast-player-bar](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-player-bar-polymer) element to handle controlling local media and casting.

##Setup
Use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to include the cast-video in your web app.

    bower install --save googlecast/cast-volume-controller-polymer
    
##Integration
You'll need to first include [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

###Including the element
In your html include the element.

    <link rel="import"
            href="bower_components/cast-video-polymer/cast-video.html">

Add the element to your DOM as a child of `cast-manager` and bind the required properties.

    <cast-video id="video"
                local-media="{{localMedia}}"
                volume="{{volume}}"
                current-time="{{currentTime}}"
                is-fullscreen="{{isFullscreen}}"
                cast-available="[[castAvailable]]"
